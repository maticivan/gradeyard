The GradeYard (https://gradeyard.com) is a learning management system designed to keep the course material, assignments, grades, and students as components of a personal website. 

Everything blends into a uniform online experience. Publicly available content is displayed to outside visitors as a responsive mobile friendly site. Students use the same site to read class notes, submit assignments, and check grades. The grading is done directly on the website. The software will collect and organize the submissions from students. 

The autograder is implemented to grade programming assignments, multiple-choice questions, and short answer questions. The grading system supports multiple versions of exams, random parameters, anonymous grading, team grading, self grading, and peer grading.
